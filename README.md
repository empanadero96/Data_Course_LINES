# BIOL3100 Exams

I will push exams to this repository when it's time. You will need to clone/pull this repo to get all the exam files and instructions.
Exams will each be in their own directory with a README file that details your tasks and the grading breakdown.

### You will submit exams by pushing them to *your* GitHub repo. Make sure that all file paths are relative, that you use an R-Project, and that any files with naming instructions are named accurately.


#### Exam topics:

Exam 1 -- Vectors, subsetting, plotting, mathematical and logical operations, importing and exporting files

Exam 2 -- Cleaning data, Tidying data, ggplot visualizations, functions

Exam 3 -- Building and testing models, making and interpreting model predictions, using common statistical tests, building a "markdown" report

Exam 4 -- Redo any one of the previous exams. New score will replace previous score **AND** will count as your score for Exam 4
